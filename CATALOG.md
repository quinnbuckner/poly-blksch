## Change log

- **Day 0 (Apr 22 2026)** — Repo scaffolded. Pydantic schemas written. Config seeded. All three track folders created with READMEs. Nothing wired yet. Committed and pushed to `origin main`.
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track B Stage 1 complete.** Shipped `mm/greeks.py`, `mm/quote.py`, `mm/guards.py`, `mm/pnl.py`, `mm/limits.py`, `mm/refresh_loop.py` (paper §4.1, §4.2 eq 8-9, §4.5, §4.6). 110 unit+integration tests green. Critical integration test `tests/integration/test_track_b_quote.py` verifies expected Quote on fixed inputs, toxicity/news spread widening, feed-gap + inventory-cap pulls. Stage 2/3 (`mm/hedge/*`) still stubbed.
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track A `polyclient.py`.** `core/ingest/polyclient.py` landed: async aiohttp + websockets client for Polymarket Gamma/CLOB REST and the CLOB `market` WS channel. Emits `BookSnap` and `TradeTick`. In-memory book state + diff application for `price_change` events. Reconnect with exponential backoff. Rate-limiter ported from `polyarb_v1.0/src/api.py`. 20 unit tests on parsers + limiter.
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track C Stage 1 complete.** Shipped `exec/clob_client.py` (py-clob-client adapter + aiohttp fallback for read-only use), `exec/signer.py` (EIP-712 Polymarket CTF Exchange v1), `exec/ledger.py` (SQLite WAL; signed-qty WAP accounting; `reconcile()` helper), `exec/paper_engine.py` (book-through + trade-tick matching; configurable queue haircut; feed-gap halt), `exec/order_router.py` (idempotent `sync_quote` with replace-on-change; retry/backoff; `live_ack` gate), `exec/dashboard.py` (Rich `Live` layout + Flask `/api/state`). 31 new unit tests and the `test_track_c_paper_engine.py` integration gate are green (161 total tests pass). Stage-2 live promotion stays gated on `RouterConfig.live_ack=True`.
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track A `store.py`.** `core/ingest/store.ParquetStore`: async append-only Parquet writer partitioned as `<root>/<stream>/<token_id>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/part-NNNNN.parquet`. `append_book` / `append_trade` wrap `asyncio.to_thread` so the ingest path never blocks; flushing is bounded by a configurable size cap (default 128 MB) that rotates to a new part file. `read_range(token_id, start_ts, end_ts, *, stream)` returns a pandas DataFrame for downstream calibration; includes in-memory buffer by default. 12 unit tests covering round-trip, date/token partitioning, rotation, empty-range reads, and buffered reads.
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track A `screener.py`.** `core/ingest/screener.Screener`: top-N liquidity picker scored by a volume/depth composite (depth-dominant at 0.7 / 0.3 by default). Consumes `PolyClient.list_markets` (added in this module — pages through Gamma) and `PolyClient.get_book` for ±5% depth sampling. `ScreenerFilters` maps directly to `config/markets.yaml`. Correlation pair hints are resolved against the scanned universe — missing-leg pairs are dropped. TTL cache (default 300 s) avoids hammering Gamma on every refresh loop. 18 unit tests covering filter boundaries, scoring monotonicity, `top_n` truncation, TTL hit/miss, `force` bypass, and pair resolution (207 total unit tests).
- **Apr 22 2026 — Track A `canonical_mid.py`.** `core/filter/canonical_mid.CanonicalMidFilter`: stream-or-batch §5.1 conditioner. Emits `CanonicalMid` at the configured `kf_grid_hz` (default 1 Hz) with trade-notional VWAP when trades in the sliding window (default 30 s), book-mid otherwise; clamps to `[eps, 1-eps]` (default 1e-5). Outlier hygiene rejects `|Δlogit|` > `K·IQR` of the trailing delta-logit window (K=4 default) — rejections are logged, the last accepted p̃ is carried forward and the output is flagged `rejected_outlier=True`. Grid cadence uses LOCF across empty bins; empty/crossed books are skipped as hygiene fails. Introduces `CanonicalMid` (non-schema dataclass, Track A-internal). 20 unit tests covering pure helpers, constructor validation, VWAP/book-mid fallback, trade-window purge, clipping at p→0 and p→1, outlier reject + recover, grid cadence, forward-fill flags, hygiene drops, and snap=None tick mode (223 total unit tests).
